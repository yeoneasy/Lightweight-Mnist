# **Lightweight Deep Learning with SWA, Pruning, and Quantization**

This project demonstrates a lightweight deep learning pipeline using **Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)**, **Pruning**, and **Quantization** on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to optimize model size and computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.

---

## **Features**
- **SWA (Stochastic Weight Averaging)**:
  - Improves generalization by averaging weights over multiple epochs.
- **Pruning**:
  - Reduces model size by removing less important parameters using L1 unstructured pruning.
- **Quantization**:
  - Converts model weights to lower precision (INT8), reducing memory usage.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Evaluation includes accuracy and model size.

---

## **Code Execution Process**

The following steps outline the workflow of the project:

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Load the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
- Normalize the dataset to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.
- Convert the data into 4-dimensional tensors with a shape of `(batch_size, channels, height, width)` for CNN compatibility.

### **2. Model Training**
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the training data.
- Use **AdamW optimizer** with a learning rate of `0.01` to minimize the **Cross-Entropy Loss**.
- Perform training for 10 epochs, using a validation dataset to monitor performance during training.

### **3. Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)**
- Apply SWA starting from the 150th epoch (`--swa_start 150`).
- Average the model weights over multiple epochs to improve generalization.

### **4. Pruning**
- Perform **L1 unstructured pruning** on convolutional layers to reduce the number of parameters.
- Pruning removes 50% (`--pruning_amount 0.5`) of the least important weights based on their L1 norm.
- Update the BatchNorm statistics to adjust for pruned weights.

### **5. Quantization**
- Convert the pruned model's weights to **INT8** format using dynamic quantization.
- Quantization reduces memory usage and improves inference speed while maintaining accuracy.

### **6. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate both the original and optimized models on the validation dataset.
- Compare the accuracy, model size, and parameter count.
